# 🏊‍♂️ Epitech C Pool (The Piscine)

This repository contains my work from the **Epitech C Pool**, a legendary four-week intensive bootcamp completed during my exchange semester. The program is designed to take students from zero to mastery in C programming and Unix logic through high-pressure, daily technical challenges.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to reflect the progression of the bootcamp, with each day focusing on a specific set of skills:

* **/tasks**: Contains the official PDF subject files for each day and project.
* **/B-CPE-100-PAR...**: Daily repositories containing exercises:
    * **Day 01**: Jenkins, files, and Unix command line basics.
    * **Day 02**: Advanced Shell scripting and environment variables.
    * **Day 03**: Introduction to C, integers, and basic terminal output.
    * **Day 04**: Pointers and the exchange of variable values.
    * **Day 05**: Mathematical logic and implementation of recursion.
    * **Day 06**: Memory manipulation and advanced string handling.
    * **Day 07**: Handling command-line arguments and creating the first `libmy.a`.
    * **Day 08**: Memory allocation (`malloc`) and complex structures.
    * **Day 09**: Advanced structures and header file management.
    * **Day 10**: Function pointers and complex project organization.
    * **Day 11**: Introduction to Linked Lists and dynamic data structures.
    * **Day 12**: File descriptors and basic File I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`).
    * **Day 13**: Introduction to graphical programming and event handling.


* **Special Challenges & Rushes**:
    * **Rush 1**: Logic-based team project (Pattern generation).
    * **Rush 2**: Language detection through character frequency analysis.
    * **Star**: A challenging algorithmic "stumper" for nested loops and patterns.
    * **CountIsland**: A recursive algorithm to identify and count clusters in a 2D grid.
    * **MyPrintf**: A complete recreation of the standard `printf` function, handling varied flags and data types.
    * **FinalStumper**: The culminating logic test of the C Pool.
 
## Key Projects

- **libmy.a**: My custom static library used throughout the bootcamp.
- **MyPrintf**: A robust implementation of the formatted output function.
